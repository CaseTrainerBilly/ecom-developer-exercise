# Responsive Product Carousel (Next.js + React)

This project features a responsive product carousel built with React and Next.js, designed to enhance the ecommerce browsing experience across all devices with modern UX patterns and accessibility in mind.

## Live Demo

## Research-Informed Design

- Built with Mobile in Mind: With over 75% of ecommerce purchases occurring on mobile or tablets, the carousel includes touch gestures, responsive layout adjustments, and vertical transitions for smaller screens to provide an optimal experience.
- Effective CTA Placement: Each product card includes a prominent "Shop Now" button. Based on ecommerce research, strong call-to-action buttons drive higher engagement and conversions.
- Graceful Degradation: Missing images or prices are handled with fallbacks to ensure visual consistency and maintain user trust.
